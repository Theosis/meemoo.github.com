Google Summer of Code 2012
--------------------------

Meemoo is a framework for building creative web apps that are *hackable by design*.
Any app that can be described by a data-flow diagram can be built in Meemoo.
Modules are web pages with a little bit of js that defines the inputs and outputs.

Another (very different) use: [economic model](http://meemoo.org/blog/2012-01-24-friction-free-post-scarcity-creative-economies)

We are seeking collaboration and contribution in the following fields:

* app/module ideas
* module/framework design 
* UX and graphic design
* community design

Some specific ideas:
--------------------

Framework

* i18n
* [qunit](http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit) unit testing
* touchscreen/mobile support + ux
* [boot-to-gecko](https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G) experimentation
* appification with [phonegap](https://github.com/phonegap) for device features
* ux and graphic design

Community

* design and build community with [Mozilla PlayDoh](https://github.com/mozilla/playdoh) (Django/Python)
* [socket](http://socket.io/) communication to Meemoo apps on your own phone (or across the world)
* [sharejs](http://sharejs.org/) collaborative editing
* view/edit source for a module (like jsfiddle or jsdo.it)  
* offline framework and modules

App/module ideas

* Instructional puzzle game based on rewiring modules
* Kaleidoscope with reconfigurable mirrors
* Text-to-song generator with computer generated voices singing in harmony
* Web video sequencer / remixer
* Artistic visualization of data from bio-sensors
* Multi-user photo/animation collage

I'll be looking for people that can work closely with me for the summer on these challenges. I'm in Helsinki, GMT+2, so we'll have to agree on common working hours.
1/4 to 1/2 of our time should be spent *using* the framework to make creative apps, and the rest getting into the nitty-gritty.

The ideal candidate will have some combination of experience with *Python, JavaScript, and flow-based programming*, and a demonstrated ability to get up to speed with the other fields by the start.

Talk to me: [email](mailto:forrest@sembiki.com), [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/meemoojs), [@forresto](http://twitter.com/forresto), or *forresto* on irc.freenode.net and irc.mozilla.org
